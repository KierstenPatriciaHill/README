1. Find your topic
  * Think of something you like, inspires you, or something you just know a lot about. Think about the people you want to listen aka whos your demographic?
  * Take into account your personality, you shouldn’t be too far out of your comfort zone.
  * Figure out if you want this to be solo or are you including other people.
2. Get the supplies 
  * Need something to record with. Whether that’s a microphone, zoom or even you phone, can’t make an audio podcast without audio. 
  * You’ll also need to a way to edit the material you’ve recorded. I recommend using either Audacity or Adobe Premiere Pro. 
3. Name it
  * It should be something to represents your topic not something totally random. 	
  * You also want to think of a name you know will be an attention grabber.
4. Record and Edit
  * Now comes the fun part, record your podcast.
  * This can be scripted or you can think of it off the top of your head. Completely up to you. 
  * It’s not too hard to edit a podcast, just make you’re cleaning it up and had a theme song. It will make get people interested.
5. Promote it!
  * Once you’re happy with your work, upload it. Itunes, Spotify and soundcloud are great places to promote your work. 
6. Keep improving	
* A podcast is never perfect. Continue is keep pushing to improve your show and draw in a bigger audience.
